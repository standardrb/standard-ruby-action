# Standard Ruby GitHub Action

A GitHub Action to run [Standard Ruby](https://github.com/standardrb/standard)
against your code. Here's what it does:

1. Runs `bundle exec standardrb --fix` on the root directory of your repo
2. If any errors were auto-fixable, it commits those changes back to the repo
3. If any errors remain, it fails the build with annotations for each failure

## Usage

### Creating a Standard Ruby workflow:

To separate Standard Ruby linting and formatting from your main test suite, you
can add it in a standalone workflow:

```yaml
name: Standard Ruby

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      checks: write
      contents: write
    steps:
    - name: Standard Ruby
      uses: standardrb/standard-ruby-action@v1
```

### Adding to an existing workflow:

You can add the following to your existing GitHub Action workflow:

```yaml
- name: Standard Ruby
  uses: standardrb/standard-ruby-action@v1
```

This will require you to add these permissions at the top-level of your workflow
(for example, after specifying the operating system via `runs_on`):

```yaml
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
permissions:
  checks: write
  contents: read
```

## Options

- `ruby-version` - If your project has a `.ruby-version` file, this Action will use that version of Ruby. If not, this will be forwarded to the [ruby/setup-ruby](https://github.com/ruby/setup-ruby) action, so it takes the same values.
- `autofix` - If set to `false`, the action will not attempt to auto-fix any errors. Defaults to `true`.
- `workdir` - If set the action will descend to this directory before running `bundle exec standardrb â€¦` and other relevant setup commands. Defaults to `.`.

Example with options set:

```yaml
- name: Standard Ruby
  uses: standardrb/standard-ruby-action@v1
  with:
    ruby-version: '3.3'
    autofix: false
    workdir: my/app/subdirectory
```

## Screenshots

**[Update 6/17/2024: the current v1 release doesn't produce annotations like
this, unfortunately. See
[#16](https://github.com/standardrb/standard-ruby-action/issues/16)]**
